# 🚀AI-Powered-Emotion-Aware-Music-Recommender-System

- EmotionMusic is a full-stack, intelligent web application designed to bridge the gap between human emotion and music discovery. Moving beyond traditional genre- or history-based recommendations, this application uses real-time facial emotion recognition to analyze a user's current mood and generate a tailored playlist of music to match it.

- The project is a complete, end-to-end system featuring a modern, animated frontend built in React, a powerful backend API built in Flask (Python), and a secure, cloud-hosted MySQL database. It handles everything from user authentication and real-time AI analysis to fetching music from the YouTube API and saving user "favorites."

## 🪄Overview
This project aims to provide an accessible, auditable pipeline for early heart disease risk prediction. It uses classical ML (and/or deep learning) with standard health features to produce risk scores and basic explanations so clinicians and users can understand model outputs.

## ✨Features
- High-Accuracy Prediction: Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier with 98.5% accuracy on the validation set to predict heart disease risk based on 13 clinical features.

- Explainable AI (XAI): Integrates the SHAP library to provide clear, user-friendly explanations for each prediction, building trust by showing which factors (e.g., cholesterol, age) contributed most to the risk score.

- Personalized Recommendations: A dynamic recommendation engine that parses the XAI results and generates actionable health advice tailored to the user's specific risk factors.

- Secure User Authentication: Full user registration and login system with secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- Document Management with OCR: Users can upload medical documents (images or PDFs), with Tesseract OCR automatically extracting text for their records.

- PDF Report Generation: Users can download a PDF summary of their prediction results for their records or to share with a healthcare provider.

- Role-Based Access: Includes a "Doctor" role with a separate dashboard to view a list of registered patients.

## Quick Demo
1. Start the app (instructions below).
2. Open the web UI at http://localhost:5000 (or the port configured).
3. Enter patient features and get a risk score with a short explanation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
### Backend
- Framework: Python 3.11, Flask, Flask-RESTful
- Authentication: Flask-JWT-Extended (for stateless JWTs)
- Database: Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- File Handling: Werkzeug secure_filename, Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- Services: Flask-Mail (for password resets), Tesseract (for OCR)

### AI / Data Science
- Model: Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, StandardScaler, Pipeline)
- Explainability (XAI): SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

### Frontend
- Core: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Framework: Bootstrap 5
- Visualization: Gauge.js (for the risk chart)
- State Management: sessionStorage is used to pass the final JSON prediction from the prediction page to the results page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Tesseract OCR
- Installation instructions can be found on the official Tesseract GitHub. You must update the path in config.py.
- Recommended: virtualenv or venv

### ⚙️Local Installation and setup
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulll13/AI-Powered-Application-for-Early-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Application.git
cd AI-Powered-Application-for-Early-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Application
```

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# for windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
### 2. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory. Use the .env.example as a template and add your credentials.
```bash
# .env file
SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key'

# For Gmail, you may need an App Password
MAIL_USERNAME='your-email@gmail.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD='your-email-password'
```
### 3. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```
### 4. Train the ML Model: This is a critical step. Run the training script to generate the serialized model and explainer files.
```bash
python train_model.py
```
### 5. Running the application
Use the provided utility script to launch both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.:
```bash
python start_servers.py
```
Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

- Submit to receive a risk score and short explanation/high-level feature contributions.

### API (example)
A sample POST request to the model endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "age": 54,
    "sex": 1,

    "chol": 239,
    "fbs": 0,
    "restecg": 1,
    "thalach": 160,
